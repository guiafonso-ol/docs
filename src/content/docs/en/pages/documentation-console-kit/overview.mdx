When you [create an edge application](/en/documentation/products/start-with-a-template/), you need to define an origin. However, more complex and robust infrastructures may need multiple origins for the same application. The [Load Balancer](/en-us/documentation/products/edge-application/load-balancer/) module allows you to use load balancing algorithms to manage high access numbers and control the behaviors of your origin.

:::caution[warning]
If **Load Balancer** is activated, data transfer could generate usage-related costs. Check the [pricing page](https://www.azion.com/en/pricing/) for more information.
