The **Critical Destructive Dialog** is used to confirm the removal of a critical entity whose removal will impact the functionality of other entities or any other client's setup.

---

## Usage

This variation contains:

- **Header**: it provides the context of the required action.
- **Warning message**: being a critical action, it alerts users the consequences of taking that action.
- **Description**: it complements the header with additional information about the critical action.
- **Input**: it's a required field so users type the name of the entity to confirm its removal.
- **Buttons**: it includes a destruction button to confirm the action, that appears red-colored as the primary button, and a secondary button to cancel the action.
- **Exit button**: it's represented by an X in the upper-right corner, enabling the user to close the dialog without taking any further action.

Within Azion's platform, current critical entities are:

- Domains
- Edge applications
- Edge firewalls
- Edge functions
- Intelligent DNS
- Edge services
- Digital certificates
- Network lists
- WAF rules

---

## Behavior

- It overlaps and obscures the current content, appearing in the middle of the page to focus the user's attention.
- It disables all functionalities when appears and remains on screen until the required action has been taken.

                <ul class="pl-2 ml-2 mt-0" style="line-height: 1.5">
                    <li>At least one lowercase</li>
                    <li>At least one uppercase</li>
                    <li>At least one numeric</li>
                    <li>Minimum 8 characters</li>
                </ul>
            </template>
        </Password>
    </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue';

const value = ref(null);
</script>

## Content

While writing a **Critical Destructive Dialog**, follow these general guidelines for each element:

- **Header**: keep it concise, clear, and short,  up to 1 line. Use the structure [action] + [name of instance] and title case, if necessary. Not periods needed.
    - Example: *Delete [instance]*
- **Warning message**: remark it's an irreversible action.
    - Example: *Once confirmed, this action can't be reversed.*
- **Description**: clarify the consequence of the action, including the instances that will be affected. Keep it up to 2 lines.
    - Example: *This [instance] will be deleted along with any associated settings or instances. Check Help Center for more details.*
- **Input**: use this field to request confirmation.
    - Example: *Type “delete” to confirm:*
- Buttons: the primary button should be the verb reflecting the action, same as the header. The secondary button is Cancel.
    - Example: [Cancel] / [Delete]

> Use the content in the [Design section](#design) as a guide to this variation.

### Best practices

- The **Critical Destructive Dialog** should be focused in completing a single task. Avoid mixing different topics. 
- Avoid repeating information across the elements. Each element has a function. 
- Be objective and clear.
- Avoid apologies, extra alarm, or ambiguous content.
