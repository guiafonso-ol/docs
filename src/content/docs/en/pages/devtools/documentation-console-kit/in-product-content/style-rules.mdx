## Grammatical person

- Avoid using grammatical persons and prioritize imperative, actionable, or instructional constructions. (Specific cases must be analyzed with the Product Content Experience team).

| Do | Don't  |
|---|---|
| *Give a unique and descriptive name to identify the application.*  | *You can give a unique and descriptive name to identify your application.* |

> ⚠️ **Exception**: system emails. They're using UXW rules overall. However, being more direct and personal communication, using the second person is recommended.

- Avoid using *We*, *I*, *us*, *our*, *my*, *mine*, and prioritize using the company's name, but only when strictly necessary. 

| Do | Don't  |
|---|---|
| *Azion Support Team.<br/> Azion's products.*  | *Our Support Team. <br/> Our products.* |

> ⚠️ **Exception**: legal documents.

## Use plain, simple, readable, and conversational language

- Prioritize using active voice. It's easier to understand and more objective.

| Do | Don't  |
|---|---|
| *The application is updated.*  | *The application has been updated by the system.* |

- Take advantage of the hierarchy of components and layout to organize your ideas. This helps you to provide the necessary information and create more scannable content.

| Recommendations |
|---|
| ✓ Use labels to identify the fields.
✓ Include descriptions, placeholders, and helper texts to guide and help through the journey.
✓ Providing this information on-screen, the user can complete the task frictionless, with no need to leave the platform. |

#### Use complete sentences that always convey a specific idea and are easy to read.

| Do | Don't  |
|---|---|
| *List the function instances in this Edge Firewall.<br/> <br/>Specify a custom path from which edge nodes will request the origin content. Example: /custom-path*  | *List your function instances in this EF.<br/> <br/>Azion can request your content from a directory in your origin. Azion appends Origin Path to the URI when forwarding the request to your origin. Leave it in blank to use only the URI. (e.g: /custom-path)*  |

> 🚫 Avoid abbreviations and Latin expressions.
>
> 🚫 Avoid acronyms. Use only in case it's an extended and common term (IP, URL, etc.)

#### Be concise and express the information in a few words. It helps users quickly understand and complete tasks within a digital interface. 

| Do | Don't  |
|---|---|
| *It's the link to access the application.*  | *It is the hyperlink that serves as the means to gain access to the application.* |

> 🚫 Avoid being verbose and using uncommon or archaic words.

- Prioritize the simplest structure to write a sentence: subject + verb + object.

| Do | Don't  |
|---|---|
| *The application is updated.*  | *The integration, which has undergone the latest update, is now running with the most recent version.* |

- Contractions help to write more conversationally and friendlyly.

| Do | Don't  |
|---|---|
| *It's the final step.<br/> <br/>Don't reload the page before finishing the process.* | *It is the final step.<br/> <br/>Do not reload the page before finishing the process.* |

> 🚫 Avoid: contractions with verbs + nouns (Browser is/ NOT Browser's).
>
> 💡It's okay to use contractions 'nt ('don't').

- Offer solutions when it's possible for the user to take further action and avoid frustration.

| Do | Don't  |
|---|---|
