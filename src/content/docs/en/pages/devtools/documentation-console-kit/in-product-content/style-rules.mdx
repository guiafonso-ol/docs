## Grammatical person

| ✅ Do | ❌ Don't |
|---|---|
| *Give a unique and descriptive name to identify the application.*  | *You can give a unique and descriptive name to identify your application.* |

:::note[Exception]
System emails are using UXW rules overall. However, being more direct and personal communication, using the second person is recommended.
:::

## Use plain, simple, readable, and conversational language

#### Prioritize using active voice. It's easier to understand and more objective.

| ✅ Do | ❌ Don't |
|---|---|
| *The application is updated.*  | *The application has been updated by the system.* |

#### Take advantage of the hierarchy of components and layout to organize your ideas. This helps you to provide the necessary information and create more scannable content.

:::tip[Recommendations]
- Use labels to identify the fields.
- Include descriptions, placeholders, and helper texts to guide and help through the journey.
- Providing this information on-screen, the user can complete the task frictionless, with no need to leave the platform.
:::

#### Use complete sentences that always convey a specific idea and are easy to read.

| ✅ Do | ❌ Don't |
|---|---|
| *List the function instances in this Edge Firewall.<br/> <br/>Specify a custom path from which edge nodes will request the origin content. Example: /custom-path*  | *List your function instances in this EF.<br/> <br/>Azion can request your content from a directory in your origin. Azion appends Origin Path to the URI when forwarding the request to your origin. Leave it in blank to use only the URI. (e.g: /custom-path)*  |

:::note[Avoid]
- Abbreviations and Latin expressions.
- Acronyms. Use only in case it's an extended and common term (IP, URL, etc.)
:::

#### Be concise and express the information in a few words. It helps users quickly understand and complete tasks within a digital interface. 

| ✅ Do | ❌ Don't |
|---|---|
| *It's the link to access the application.*  | *It is the hyperlink that serves as the means to gain access to the application.* |

:::note[Avoid]
Avoid being verbose and using uncommon or archaic words.
:::

#### Prioritize the simplest structure to write a sentence: subject + verb + object.

| ✅ Do | ❌ Don't |
|---|---|
| *The application is updated.*  | *The integration, which has undergone the latest update, is now running with the most recent version.* |

#### Contractions help to write more conversationally and friendlyly.

| ✅ Do | ❌ Don't |
|---|---|
| *It's the final step.<br/> <br/>Don't reload the page before finishing the process.* | *It is the final step.<br/> <br/>Do not reload the page before finishing the process.* |

:::note[Avoid]
Contractions with verbs + nouns (Browser is/ NOT Browser's). However, it's okay to use contractions 'nt ('don't').

## Be more accurate and instructive

#### Explain the consequences and/or the results of an action to the user and help the user understand the decision.

:::tip[Recommendations]
- Use the title to provide context.
- In teh description, explain the situation/consequences of actions, provide further information or next steps.
- Confirm the action through the buttons. Content must be aligned with the title.
:::

#### Offer solutions when it's possible for the user to take further action and avoid frustration.

| ✅ Do | ❌ Don't  |
|---|---|
| *Add a payment method to use Azion with no interruptions.*  | *You need to keep your Azion account running to continue using the service.* |

#### Show further steps to the user, if possible. Be the guide to progress in the product and encourage action.

| ✅ Do | ❌ Don't  |
|---|---|
| *Go to the Domains page for further configuration.<br/> <br/>Get a head start by clicking the card below.*  | *FALTA EXEMPLO AQUI* |
